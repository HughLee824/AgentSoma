# iPhone-use

Use the local CLI to observe and act on the iPhone. The agent chooses actions and verifies results; execution receipts alone do not prove task success. Workflow version: **0.3.1**; requires CLI **0.4.0+**.

## Start

1. Run `sh scripts/preflight.sh` relative to this skill's absolute directory. Read the relevant adapter in the same tool invocation when possible: [Codex](references/codex-calls.md), [Claude Code](references/claude-code.md), [DeepSeek Harness](references/deepseek-harness.md), or [other clients](references/generic-agent.md). Preflight checks local capabilities, not phone readiness. Honor an explicitly supplied `IPHONE_USE_CLI`; use `--candidate` for prereleases or `--source` for development builds. Keep the same executable throughout.
2. Run `devices`, then `connect --device DEVICE_ID --reuse --progress` with the returned physical UDID and supported flags. A successful connection already includes status. Record `session`, `mode`, `modeSource`, `reused` and `lifecycle`. Never obtain a session ID from another task's files. A conflict needs diagnosis, not killing another host.
3. Keep the saved control mode. Do not add a mode override, change configuration, or automatically switch backends. Runner uses XCTest/AX; standard uses screenshots/HID.
4. Default to [live preview](references/live-preview.md) before the first observation, unless the user declined it. **When preview is declined, skip its startup and reference entirely.** Preview is separate from control; keep its ownership record if started.

Before starting Runner, tell the user to keep the phone unlocked and complete Enable UI Automation **if it appears**. With `--progress`, stream messages using short tool yields. Relay `requiresUserAction=true` promptly, identifying authorization only from accompanying evidence; keep waiting on the original execution handle. Slowness alone does not establish a prompt. Read [connection progress](references/connection-progress.md) only for authorization trouble, setup or early preview.

## Observe, choose, verify

Discover unknown bundle IDs using `apps --query NAME`; use returned IDs, not guesses. Use the installed app's displayed name when known. A localized query with no matches may need the alternate displayed name; no match is not a connection diagnosis.

Commands below follow `--session SESSION`:

| Intent | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Open and observe | `open BUNDLE_ID --observe --agent-output` |
| Tap an observed Runner element | `tap oN:eN --observe --agent-output` |
| Tap a screenshot target | `tap oN --x X --y Y --observe --agent-output` |
| Capture without input | `observe` |
| Search the captured AX tree | `inspect oN --query TEXT` |
| Release an owned session | `disconnect` |

Use `--agent-output` only where preflight advertises it; it is not a global flag. `--observe` returns separate action and observation facts. **Read the attached PNG before selecting the next action**, including after a nonzero exit. Do not add another capture when the returned observation is usable. `inspect` searches cached data and cannot revive stale references.

- `completed`: execution completed or verified no-op; inspect the actual UI result.
- `prepared`: clipboard staged, no text inserted; continue the returned touch-paste workflow.
- `unknown`: input may have occurred. Inspect without replaying it.
- `not_dispatched`: no input sent. Correct the evidenced cause; a current attached observation satisfies `requiresObservation`.

Partial output is pending: resume the same execution handle, never restart the command to recover its result. Observation/image-read failure cannot erase action facts. After uncertain or partial text, establish actual contents before any new input; never automatically resend the original text.

Screenshot dimensions are pixels; input uses `screen_points`. Map against the image dimensions actually displayed. After navigation, keyboard/layout changes or scrolling, reselect targets and geometry from the new image. Keep default guards. For `screen_changed`, `stale_observation`, continuous animation or dynamic taps, read [screen guards](references/screen-guards.md) before changing guard options. `stable=false` is a usable but unsettled frame, not failed input or permission to replay.

## Text

**Runner:** prefer `type CURRENT --text TEXT --observe --agent-output` without `--method`. A current `keyboard_focus=true` on the exact input establishes observed focus; the backend still checks live identity and focus before dispatch. If focus is not established, use `focus CURRENT --observe`, inspect, then type using the new reference. Never infer focus solely from a visible keyboard. `textMethods: ["touch-paste"]` lists an optional method, not the default element typing capability.

Read [Runner editing](references/runner-actions.md) for replace/append/clear/selection/keys. Runner has no implicit replace or append. Read [touch paste](references/touch-paste.md) only for an explicit request or concrete direct-input incompatibility/no usable AX target. Language, emoji and length alone do not justify fallback; uncertain input never justifies replay via another method.

**Standard:** read [native text](references/native-text.md) before first text input, prepare its keyboard once, then use fresh field evidence. Read [wheels](references/wheels.md) only for picker-wheel work.

## Evidence and finish

When evidence is requested, preserve the returned screenshot, snapshot and receipt together before the next device action; the cache keeps only two observations and disconnect removes it. When preflight advertises native evidence, append `--evidence-dir DIR` to connect and session commands; use returned `artifacts` paths. Older CLIs can use the fixed output helper described in the Codex adapter. Call the CLI directly; do not generate execution wrappers. Retain connection mode evidence from the existing receipt. Archive only to the requested private directory; ordinary tasks need no extra reports.

Verify requested fields and the resulting saved/sent UI. Continue authorized work; do not impose a fixed route, extra reopening step or cleanup the user did not request. For feed cutoffs, establish the actual date boundary; a relative label alone may be insufficient.

For a **created** session, disconnect and inspect its cleanup acknowledgement. A complete acknowledgement needs no extra status or process query; investigate only missing/failed cleanup. For a **borrowed** session, leave it running unless the user requests disconnect. Release only owned preview/recording resources; newer independent previews need their own explicit stop. Report unresolved execution or cleanup honestly.

For setup, missing CLI, discovery timeouts or other access failures, read [access recovery](references/access-recovery.md). Do not preload recovery references during normal execution.
