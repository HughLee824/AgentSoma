# Observation fixtures

`Observations/app.json` and `Observations/system-alert.json` contain selected AX attributes recorded from a controlled AgentSoma test app and its system notification prompt. They are regression inputs, not examples of the public CLI response format.

The fixtures preserve node order, parent relationships, geometry, labels, and values. Developer bundle IDs are replaced with `com.example.agentsoma.fixture`, timestamps use fixed example values, and local paths, request/session IDs, process metadata, and the original response envelope are removed.

SwiftPM copies this directory into the test resource bundle. `observationFixture` loads it through `Bundle.module`, supplies the current observation metadata, and generates a synthetic PNG with `screenPNG()`. No physical device, original screenshot, local experiment, or documentation file is required.

Keep fixture data small and sanitized. Changes to node order or attributes should reflect an intentional regression case because tests exercise specific captured nodes.
